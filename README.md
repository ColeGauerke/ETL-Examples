ETL's (Extract, Transform, and Load) functions are a staple in data science and analytics. The primary goal is to extract data from one, or multiple sources, transform or manipulate the data, and then load the transofmed data into a database. These are three ETL pipelines that I designed using sample data from KAGGLE and created each one in Jupyter Notebooks. Each program has an extract, transform, and load function. The extract functions are all the same, a simple function to read a csv file using the pandas library. Each notebook has a unique transform function where I demonstrated multiple processes,filters, and applications to clean up and filter the through the data. The load functions load the transormed data set to a local database I have created in one umbrella ETL folder.
